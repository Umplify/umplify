    title: SaaS Transformation
    excerpt: Startups, Independent Software Vendors, and large enterprises are employing cloud infrastructure to make their products available 24/7, fault-tolerant, secure, and scalable as their businesses grow. This technological demand dictates modernizing applications' architecture to adapt models like Platform-as-a-Service (Paas), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). With the evolving cloud technologies, our team has enough expertise to seamlessly steer your business through all possible challenges. Should you wish to transform your SaaS application to Azure Cloud, our team is ready to help you to implement a solid strategy for a successful SaaS transformation.

## Assessment

We start our engagement by learning about your company's business model, the application's users and tenants, licensing model, customer support, your roadmap, and the milestones. We will also thoroughly analyze your application's architecture, code, database, continuous delivery, and security to understand your application's state and offering.

## Implementing success strategy

Offering a SaaS application implies the need for high availability, multi-tenancy, user management, licensing, traffic resilience, greater security, and seamless upgrades. We will make the necessary recommendations based on Azure Cloud's components and services to optimize your SaaS application's architecture, code quality, continuous integration and delivery, security, and fail-over support.

## Presentation

We present our recommendations during a meeting to discuss our strategy for putting a sustainable infrastructure and application architecture in place. We will highlight the construction phase's necessary tools, code release, and branching strategies, Azure Cloud components to utilize, associated costs, the extent of scalability and resilience, DevOps, and automation to deploy the application to multiple environments like Dev, Test, UAT and production.

## Implementation

Implementing and developing cloud applications is our critical service to our clients. We will partner with your company to implement your cloud application in-house at Umplify, or to extend your development team by embedding our resources into it to commence the construction phase. Should you wish to employ our strategy in SaaS transformation only, the presentation phase will conclude our engagement while we are always available for further consultation and solution augmentation.
