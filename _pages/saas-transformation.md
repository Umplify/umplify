# SaaS Transformation

We have tailored this solution to help companies considering cloud adoption, or they are at their early stage of adopting it for their business. This solution or process comprises the following phases:

## Assessment

Our senior developers and architects are expert in the Microsoft Azure Cloud technology and harness its powerful platform to transform your business with cloud-native application modernization. We have architectured and constructed some enterprise applications using the most advanced and cutting-edge cloud technologies. We engage our subject-matter experts with your key team members to review, understand your business model, and document the current status and your ultimate goal. In this phase, we also try to intake key requirements including security, application architecture, user traffic, infrastructure, DevOps, and the allocated budget.

## Implementing success strategy

We leverage a team of unparalleled architects and star developers at Umplify. Following the assessment phase this team dives into the collected data and information to analyze and discusses the requirements to come up with a sustainable, scalable and modern solutions for your business. Should further consultation, idea verification and clarification become necessary, we will reach out to seek your team's inputs during this phase. 


## Presentation

we present our recommendations during a meeting to discuss our strategy in putting a sustainable infrastructure and application architecture in place. We will highlight the construction phase's necessary tools, code release and branching strategies, Azure Cloud components to utilize, associated costs, the extent of scalability and resilience, DevOps, and automation to deploy the application to multiple environments like Dev, Test, UAT and production. 

## Implementation

Implementing and developing the cloud applications is our key service to our clients. We will partner with your company to implement your cloud application in house at Umplify, or to extend your development team by embedding our resources into it to commence the construction phase. Should you wish to employ our strategy in cloud adoption, the presentation phase will conclude our engagement while we are always available for further consultation and solution augmentation.
