  - title: Securing applications
  excerpt: We leverage an array of security tools available on Microsoft Azure to secure your software and its infrastructure to ensure your users are authentic and they are the ones who are supposed to access your platform. We also provide tools and solutions to store and retrieve your data on cloud infrastructure securely.
  - title: Building scalable Microservices
  excerpt: We possess the knowledge of refactoring and modernizing the architecture of legacy applications to more efficient and cloud-powered microservices. We leverage event-driven technologies, serverless architecture, and app services to get your applications' tiers hosted on the cloud.
  - title: Saving operating costs
  excerpt: Our approach ensures your application is resilient to traffic spikes, highly available, and consumes resources only when needed. Therefore, the cost of hosting and operating your application becomes minimal when there is no demand.
  - title: Redundancy and autoscaling
  excerpt: We employ contemporary technologies like [Docker](https://docker.com) to containerize your applications, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), or [Microsoft Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-apps/) to fully manage and orchestrate them to ensure redundancy and high-availability is in place. This approach eliminates downtimes for mission-critical applications even when upgrading the code.
  - title: Real-time applications
  excerpt: We can offer cloud-based serverless solutions for your real-time application like chat applications or IoT devices to guarantee communication at blazing speed and instant. This real-time communication can be on the UI side of the application or between the backend infrastructure's tiers.
  - title: Content Delivery Network
  excerpt: If you wish your static web app to be as close as possible to your end users to experience minimal latency, we help your team continuously deploy your UI apps to Azure cloud-powered CDN by CI/CD pipelines.
