## About our founder

Arash Sabet is a veteran of the software industry and highly experienced in providing robust and cutting-edge technology solutions. His extensive experiences in product conception, design, and implementation have led to many successful cloud-based, highly efficient, and scalable enterprise solutions.

Arash is an entrepreneur with a strong vision for the unlimited potential of cutting-edge technologies and is keen on finding creative solutions for the problems of todayâ€™s constantly changing business landscape. As the co-founder of his former startup company, Proximitia Inc., he designed, implemented, and rolled out an enterprise platform to create an infrastructure of Bluetooth Access Points to help digital marketers launch and manage proximity marketing campaigns by targeting mobile devices. 

He also initiated and led the implementation of several R&D projects at Umplify Inc., such as creating a solution to guarantee data consistency across a distributed environment where distributed database transactions are not present. He also started and led an Artificial Intelligence project as a solution to the problem of the tedious and labor-intensive task of shortlisting and screening job candidates. This solution serves the Human Resource industry by employing and augmenting machine learning algorithms, text analysis, NLP, and sentiment extraction. These projects were awarded funding and received SR&ED tax credits from the Canadian Government.

The primary business objective at Umplify Inc. has been providing clients with enterprise-scale custom software solutions, and Arash has engaged with and led many Fintech solutions in the Canadian finance sector. That has been either by acquiring new clients or partnerships with other businesses to provide cloud solutions. 

Umplify Inc.'s projects were cloud solutions like POS ancillary revenue technology used by airlines like United and Alaska Airlines, insurance rating systems, DuckCreek integration, actuary systems, and accounting & project management software.
