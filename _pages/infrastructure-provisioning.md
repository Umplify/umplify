# Infrastructure Provisioning

We have tailored this solution to help companies considering provisioning their Azure Cloud application's infrastructure by code. This solution or process comprises the following phases:

## Assessment

Our senior developers, DevOps engineers, and architects are experts in the Microsoft Azure Cloud technology and harness its powerful platform to transform your business with cloud-native application modernization. Our architects and DevOps engineers will engage with your software team to understand the architectural components of your application hosted on Azure Cloud.

## Implementing success strategy

Once our DevOps engineers process the necessary information collected during the assessment phase, they will implement a set of Terraform or bicep scripts to provision your application's infrastructure on the cloud. They will ensure that they can add, remove or update the cloud resources by the implemented scripts only. Developing such scripts will take place in Umplify's Azure Cloud subscription.

## Presentation

We will arrange a demo session to show you how the implemented Terraform or Bicep script provisions your application's infrastructure on the cloud. We will also show you how to invoke the scripts from the Azure DevOps pipeline, command line, or even a template spec where applicable.

## Implementation

Implementing and developing cloud applications is our critical service to our clients. We will partner with your company to implement your cloud application in-house at Umplify or to extend your development team by embedding our resources into it to commence the construction phase. Should you wish to employ our strategy in cloud adoption, the presentation phase will conclude our engagement while we are always available for further consultation and solution augmentation.
